    "**2)** Abbiamo osservato come, dato il file di community e la rete totale (attack + trade + message), non tutti i nodi sono presenti in questo file. Indagando su questi abbiamo poi osservato che subiscono (nella maggior parte dei casi) attacchi. Possiamo quindi dedurre che si tratti effettivamente di nodi non affiliati a nessuna alleanza in quanto utenti che hanno smesso di giocare o stanno iniziando a giocare (alcuni non subiscono attacchi ma commerciano e attaccano, scudo prottetivo 30 giorni, punteggio minimo giocare)? <br>\n",
    "2) è normale in quanto le community segnate sono quelle registrate dagli utenti stessi sul server, quindi è possibile che alcuni nodi non siano affiliati a nessuna alleanza\n",

    "**3)** Le misure di centralità sono possibili per reti multigrafo? <br>\n",
